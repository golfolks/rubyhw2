1.List of changes
Here we need to include stringify_path in the routes.rb to put the application properly
 post 'stringify'  => 'pages#stringify'
then needed to create the view called stringify.html.erb and add the code shown below to stringify.html.erb so that we can get the result
<p>My Stringify output</p> <%= @text %>

the image is attached in the file.
